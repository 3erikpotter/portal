## What is a Cycles Management Service?

Once deployed to the Internet Computer, developers need to pay in cycles for the compute and storage utilized by their canisters. The process of burning cycles and transferring them to a canister is referred to as "topping-up" a canister.

Instead of manually topping up a canister via dfx or scripting a custom solution, cycles management services provide tested topup automation and and canister metric insights so you can focus on what you do best, building a hit application!
